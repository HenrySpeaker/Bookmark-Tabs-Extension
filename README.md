# Bookmark Open Tabs Extension

This extension allows users to save some or all open tabs as bookmarks. Users can choose where the bookmarks are saved and they can specify the name of the folder where the bookmarks will be saved. In addition, users can choose to bookmark all open tabs, all regular/incognito tabs, or just tabs in the current window.

The extension also allows users to automatically open saved bookmarks, either by opening all bookmarks in a single window or opening each folder's bookmarks in a separate window.

The extension is available for Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, etc.) [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-open-tabs/ljlbjgkppmkeaacgjbhenkblcjahfhla?hl=en-US) and for Firefox browsers [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bookmark-open-tabs/).
